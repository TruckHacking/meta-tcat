This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-uthp layer, corresponding to the [UTHP project](https://github.com/SystemsCyber/UTHP).

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

## From scratch:

```shell
mkdir uthp-dev
cd uthp-dev
```
Download the uthp-setup-dev-env.sh script:
```shell
wget https://github.com/SystemsCyber/meta-uthp/raw/scarthgap/uthp-setup-dev-env.sh
```
Run it:
> Note: Performed as user with passwordless sudo within Linux env.
```shell
chmod +x uthp-setup-dev-env.sh
./uthp-setup-dev-env.sh
```
After it has run, you'll need to source oe-init-build-env EVERY TIME YOU OPEN A NEW TERMINAL:
```shell
cd Yocto
source oe-init-build-env
```

Then you can build the image:
> IMPORTANT: you need to have all the standards (e.g., J1939db.json) under the same location so our recipe can pull them. Otherwise delete or modify the [base files recipe](./recipes-core/base-files/)
> Copy the files that you have with e.g. `cp ../../../*.json meta-uthp/recipes-core/base-files/files/; cp ../../../*.pdf.txt meta-uthp/recipes-core/base-files/files/`
> The files must be generated from the SAE PDFs as described in the pretty-j1939 and pretty_j1587 projects.


```shell
bitbake core-image
```
> DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING while the build is running. It will take a while to complete for the first time. Maybe go get a coffee or something:
```shell
tmux new-session -d -s core-image 'bitbake <image>'
```
After the image is complete, you can flash it to your device from 'deploy-ti/images/uthp/core-image-uthp.rootfs.wic.xz' with your favorite flashing tool (tested with balenaEtcher). 

**If the device doesn't boot after inserting the microSD card, you will need to hold down the [s2](https://forum.beagleboard.org/t/how-does-beagleboard-determine-if-s2-is-pressed-during-boot/38587/2) button to force the bootloader to use the correct media.**

After inserting the microSD card, you can connect to the device via the USB cable. The device will show up as a serial device on your computer. To connect to the device, you can use Windows 10/11, Linux, or Mac with the following command:
```shell
ssh root@192.168.7.2
```
or 
```shell
screen /dev/tty<port> 115200
```
or 
```shell
minicom -D /dev/tty<port> -b 115200
```
or
```
putty.exe -serial COM<#> -sercfg 115200,8,1,n,n
```
> Note there are 4 serial device interfaces served by the device. You can only use one of them for logging in. The other 3 are for diagnostics.
